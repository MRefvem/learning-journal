### Growth Mindset defined

What is a *growth mindset* to me? A growth mindset is all about remaining positive about the process of learning. Being open to new ideas and not getting jealous of your peers; instead finding inspiration and a way forward. A growth mindset also occurs when we first acknowledge our starting point **and** being aware that improvement will take some hard work but that it is worth it in the end.

### Ways to stay in the growth mindset

- Acknowledge that every journey has a starting point
- There will be tough moments but you can always get help
- Find motivation to **try again** after failure
