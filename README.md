### Growth Mindset

What is a growth mindset to me? A growth mindset is all about remaining positive about the process of learning. Being open to new ideas and not being negatively affected by the accomplishments of your peers; instead finding inspiration and a way forward. A growth mindset also occurs when we first acknowledge our starting point and being aware that improvement will take some hard work but that it is worth it in the end.
