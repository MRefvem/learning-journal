### Design Web Pages With CSS

#### Duckett Chapter 10 introducing CSS

Imagine for a second that surrounding every element in an HTML file there is an invisible box. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows us to manipulate aspects of these boxes in any way we like, adding color, choosing a font (typeface), choosing the color of the font, adding a border, etc. Simply put, CSS allows us to stylize our code we set up in HTML. Web pages are made up of two files, html and css files. You get the two files to interact by putting a link to the css into your html code `<link href="css/example.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />`

Link an external CSS to your HTML using the method above or include CSS elements within your HTML file like this 

`<style type="text/css">
body {
    font-family: arial ;
    background-color: rgb(185.179.175);}
    h1 {
        color: rgb(255.255.255);}
</style>`
